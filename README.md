This project was created by following the "Getting Started with Spring Data JPA" course on PluralSight.

**Functionality:**

This project simulates a database of guitars, holding detailed information on each guitar from the location
it's made, to the manufacturer, model and model type.

**Technical Info:**

The project uses Java (specifically Spring Framework and Spring Data JPA), Hibernate and an embedded H2 database. It has a Model and Repository tier for defining the data and interacting with the database respectively.
Tests are created using JUnit framework.

This project has no frontend, and instead showcases the various functionality provided by Spring Data JPA and Hibernate, extending
far beyond basic CRUD functions. It does this through various JUnit test scenarios to run each method with simulated data.
